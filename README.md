This is my first ever website! It is a university project that was crafted during the GIN446 Web Programming course.
The website was previously deploy on infinityfree hosting but it has been suspended due to inactivity. You can test it locally using XAMPP, after implementing some tweaks in the PHP files to match with XAMPP.
Thank You!
