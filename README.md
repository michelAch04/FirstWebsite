Hey! This is my first ever website! It is a university project that was crafted during the Web Programming course.
During the implementation of this website, I learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend as well as PHP for the backend. 
The website was previously deploy on infinityfree hosting but it has been suspended due to inactivity. You can test it locally using XAMPP, after implementing some tweaks in the PHP file to match the database of XAMPP.
Happy Coding!
