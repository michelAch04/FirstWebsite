                    <h2>Introduction to Web Security</h2>
                    <p>Web security is a broad category of security solutions that protect your users, devices, and
                        wider
                        network against internet-based cyberattacks—malware, phishing, and more—that can lead to
                        breaches
                        and
                        data loss.</p>
                    <p>It reduces the security risk to your organization when your users accidentally access malicious
                        files
                        and
                        websites through some combination of firewall inspection, intrusion prevention system (IPS)
                        scanning,
                        sandboxing, URL filtering, and various other security and access controls.</p>
                    <p>All members of society — be they enterprises, governments or end users — are gathering, storing,
                        processing and transferring vast amounts of data online on a daily basis. As a result,
                        cybersecurity
                        threats evolve rapidly as the scope of the Internet expands. In the beginning, nobody needed
                        internet
                        security, but as malware, ransomware and other kinds of malicious viruses became prevalent, the
                        problem
                        emerged and became increasingly global.</p>
                    <p>In a world that relies on the Internet, cybersecurity is king. By now, cyberattackers have become
                        true
                        innovators as they have managed to advance their approach to infiltrating systems. In order to
                        defend
                        ourselves, we must keep pace with new technological advancements. Innovations in cybersecurity
                        are
                        laying a new foundation of defense against unwanted attacks.</p>

                        <p>Data breaches occur when hackers gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, often
                            through
                            weaknesses in web applications. With more data stored online, breaches have become a
                            critical
                            concern, especially for organizations handling personal and financial information.</p>

                        <h3>Social engineering attacks</h3>
                        <p>Social engineering is the term used for a broad range of malicious activities accomplished
                            through
                            human
                            interactions. It uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making security
                            mistakes or
                            giving
                            away sensitive information.</p>
                        <p>Social engineering attacks happen in one or more steps. A perpetrator first investigates the
                            intended
                            victim to gather necessary background information, such as potential points of entry and
                            weak
                            security
                            protocols, needed to proceed with the attack. Then, the attacker moves to gain the victim’s
                            trust
                            and
                            provide stimuli for subsequent actions that break security practices, such as revealing
                            sensitive
                            information or granting access to critical resources.</p>
                        <p>What makes social engineering especially dangerous is that it relies on human error, rather
                            than
                            vulnerabilities in software and operating systems. Mistakes made by legitimate users are
                            much
                            less
                            predictable, making them harder to identify and thwart than a malware-based intrusion.</p>
                        <p>Social engineering attacks come in many different forms and can be performed anywhere where
                            human
                            interaction is involved. The following are the five most common forms of digital social
                            engineering

                                curiosity.
                                They

                            state-approved hacktivism. Individual hacking groups are increasingly launching
                            politically-motivated
                            cyberattacks.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the growth of attacks by nation-state actors, their tools and techniques have
                            begun
                            seeping into the private sector. With this advanced malware available on private
                            marketplaces,
                            more
                            cybercrime groups can perform attacks at this level.</p>
                        <p>These attacks commonly target private sector organizations of various sizes. Attacking an
                            organization
                            can be used to steal valuable data (customer information, intellectual property, etc.), hold
                            data or
                            systems for ransom, or target high-profile executives within an organization.</p>

                        <h3>AI and automation</h3>
                        <p>AI’s integration into cybersecurity is a natural progression of technology. Its ability to
                            process
                            large
                            volumes of data and learn from patterns makes it the perfect tool for rapid threat detection
                            and
                            mitigation.</p>
                        <p>Not only has AI become a powerful defense mechanism, but it has also given rise to a new
                            generation
                            of
                            cyber threats. Attackers can now exploit AI’s capabilities to wreak havoc.</p>
                        <p>Machine learning algorithms can be trained to find and exploit software vulnerabilities,
                            enabling
                            more
                            precise and efficient attacks. Intrusion detection evasion, once the domain of skilled
                            hackers,
                            is
                            now
                            augmented by AI. Attackers can use AI algorithms to identify patterns in security systems
                            and
                            devise
                            strategies to bypass them. Even AI-powered phishing attacks, capable of crafting convincing
                            messages
                            by
                            analyzing communication patterns, pose significant challenges.</p>
                        <p>The intelligent agents bring a slew of advantages that empower malicious actors in
                            unprecedented
                            ways.
                            AI-driven bots can autonomously navigate through intricate website structures, swiftly
                            adapting
                            to
                            changes and updates. Their ability to mimic human behavior grants them a cloak of
                            invisibility,
                            allowing
                            them to blend seamlessly into legitimate traffic.</p>
