                    <h2>History of CSS</h2>

                    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
                    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
                        document written in HTML or XML. CSS defines how elements should be rendered on screen, on
                        paper, in speech, or on other media. CSS saves a lot of work, as it can control the layout of
                        multiple web pages all at once.</p>

                    <h3>How was it invented?</h3>
                    <p>Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized
                        Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s. One requirement for a web style sheet language was for
                        style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet
                        languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable.</p>
                    <p>The invention of HTML by computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s allowed content to
                        be displayed on websites. However, HTML did not offer styling options. Prior to CSS, some style
                        sheets existed, but they were built into their respective browsers and were proprietary to them.
                        Moreover, the options provided by these style sheets were limited.</p>
                    <p>CSS was first proposed in 1994, by Norwegian technologist Håkon Wium Lie, who was then working at
                        the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) with Berners-Lee. Their vision was to
                        separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), thus simplifying web development and making it
                        more flexible.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, several stylesheets were proposed and discussions on public mailing lists and
                        World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation being released in
                        the year 1996. Bert Bos, a Dutch computer scientisht, also made an influential proposal and
                        became the co-author of CSS1 and therefore regarded as one of the creators of CSS.</p>

                <section id="version" class="fade-in">
                    <h2>CSS Version History</h2>

                    <h3>CSS1 (December 1996)</h3>
                    <p> The first official CSS specification, CSS1, was introduced in 1996. It allowed for basic
                        stylings, such as text styling and font properties, margins, padding, color and background
                        styling, and the box model, but was limited in terms of layout control. Web browser support was
                        minimal and thus prevented the popularity of CSS Level 1 for several years.</p>

                    <h3>CSS2 (May 1998)</h3>
                    <p>CSS2 introduced a plethora of new features, including positioning, improved control over layout,
                        and also introduced styles for other media types and more sophisticated methods for selecting
                        elements for styling.</p>

                    <h3>CSS2.1 (June 2011)</h3>
                    <p>An important revision that fixed inconsistencies and errors found in CSS2. This version focused
                        on clarifying and improving the CSS2 specification, providing greater stability and browser
                        compatibility.</p>

                    <h3>CSS3 (Ongoing)</h3>
                    <p>Rather than being released as a single, monolithic specification, CSS3 is divided into several
                        separate modules, each adding new features and capabilities. These modules include Selectors,
                        Box Model, Backgrounds and Borders, Text Effects, 2D/3D Transformations, Animations, Flexbox,
                        Grid Layout, and more. Modules are standardized independently, allowing for faster development
                        and browser implementation.</p>

                    <h3>CSS4 (in development)</h3>
                    <p>CSS4 is the future of CSS, aiming to further enhance web design capabilities, including
                        responsive design, variable fonts, and improved grid systems.</p>

                <section id="rules" class="fade-in">
                    <h2>CSS Rules</h2>

                    <h3>What are they?</h3>
                    <p>A CSS rule is a grouping of one or more CSS properties which are to be applied to one or more
                        target HTML elements. <br>
                        A CSS rule consists of a CSS selector and a set of CSS properties. The CSS selector determines
                        what HTML elements to target with the CSS rule. The CSS properties specifies what to style of
                        the targeted HTML elements.</p>

                    <h3>At-Rules</h3>
                    <p>At-rules are CSS statements that instruct CSS how to behave. They begin with an at sign '@',
                        followed by an identifier, and include everything up to the next semicolon, or the next CSS
                        block, whichever comes first.
                        <br>
                        <b>Statement at-rules</b> end in a semicolon. There are several statement at-rules,
                        designated by their identifiers, each with a different syntax:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>@charset:</b> An algorithm that determines the fallback character set used by the style
                            sheet.

                        <li><b>@import:</b> Tells the CSS engine to include an external style sheet.</li>
                        <li><b>@layer:</b> Defines the order of precedence in case of multiple cascade layers. Also used

                        <li><b>@namespace:</b> Defines a default namespace for a style sheet or a namespace prefix that
                            a
                            selector only matches if the namespace and other selector components match.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <p id="block"><b>Block at-rules</b> end in a {}-block that contain nested rules, other at-rules, or
                        property or
                        descriptor declarations:</p>

                        <li><b>@font-face: </b>Defines font resource locations, both local and external, along with the
                            style characteristics for when those resources are used with a declared font-family.</li>
                        <li><b>@font-feature-values </b>(plus @swash, @ornaments, @annotation, @stylistic, @styleset and

                            defining CSS styles for intermediate steps (or keyframes) in the animation sequence.</li>
                        <li><b>@layer: </b>Creates a named cascade layer with the CSS rules for that layer inside. Also
                            used as a statement at-rule to define the order of precedence in case of multiple cascade
                            layers.</li>
                        <li><b>@media: </b>A conditional group rule that applies its content if the device meets the

                        <li><b>@scope: </b>Defines a scope in which to apply them to selected elements and the styles to
                            apply to the elements in that scope.</li>

                            from when the element receives its first style update, such as when transitioning from
                            "display: none".</li>
                        <li><b>@supports: </b>A conditional group rule applies its content if the browser supports the
